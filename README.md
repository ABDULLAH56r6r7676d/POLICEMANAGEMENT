The Crime Tracking and Case Management System is a Java Swing–based desktop application developed to digitally manage police crime records in an organized and efficient manner. The system enables users to add new crime cases with unique case IDs, store detailed information such as case title, description, status, and assigned detective, and view all cases in a readable format. It also allows the registration of detectives using their name and badge number and ensures that only existing detectives can be assigned to cases, maintaining data integrity. The application uses object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation through classes like CaseManager, CrimeCase, Detective, and the abstract Person class. ArrayLists are used as the primary data structure for dynamic storage, while bubble sort algorithms are manually implemented to sort cases by case ID or status. File handling is used to save and retrieve case and detective data from text files, ensuring persistence across multiple runs of the application. The graphical user interface, built with Java Swing components such as JFrame, JPanel, JButton, and JOptionPane, provides a simple and user-friendly experience, making the system suitable for basic crime case tracking and management in a police department.
